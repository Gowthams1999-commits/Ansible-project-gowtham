## Ansible vault

 • Ansible can automate tasks for teams such as:
   • Hardware
   • Operating systems
   • Virtualization
   • Database or Storage
   • Applications/Software etc.
   • Oftentimes you have to share Ansible code with these groups over the network and 
anything you share over network has a risk to end up in wrong hands
 • It is best practice to use Ansible vault
